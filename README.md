# ML Algorithms Project

## Overview

This project involves implementing and evaluating machine learning algorithms using two CSV files. The goal is to demonstrate how different algorithms can be applied to real-world data and how their performance can be compared.

## Data Files

1. **data1.csv**: This file contains [brief description of the data in data1.csv, e.g., "customer information with features such as age, income, and purchase history"].
2. **data2.csv**: This file contains [brief description of the data in data2.csv, e.g., "product reviews with features such as review text, rating, and product ID"].
